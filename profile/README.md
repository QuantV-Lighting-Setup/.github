## What is QuantV Lighting Setup?

QuantV Lighting Setup is a visual configuration profile created to refine atmosphere, color tone, and lighting consistency inside GTA V.  
The setup focuses on adjusting exposure levels, ambient haze, and overall brightness distribution across different weather and time-of-day conditions.

It enhances readability during daytime scenes, improves clarity at night, and reduces overly sharp contrasts.  
Because it uses built-in graphics parameters, QuantV Lighting Setup operates without modifying game files and maintains game stability.

The configuration is especially useful for creators, screenshot artists, roleplay environments, and anyone who prefers a smooth, cinematic lighting style with balanced environmental depth.
